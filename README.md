### Hi, I'm Andrei â€” Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

Here you can find some of the independent machine learning projects I pursued to flesh out my skillset while changing careers from experimental physics research to quantitative finance. My personal favorite is [Hoops Hero](https://github.com/andreilevin/HoopsHero#hoops-hero), which also has an interactive web app you can play around with at [hoopshero.streamlit.app](https://hoopshero.streamlit.app).

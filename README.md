### Hi, I'm Andrei â€” Welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“Œ At this time I am actively seeking a researcher position in quantitative finance (please message me for resume)

I am a former quantum physicist (click [here](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/41121324) for my PhD thesis) who has spent the last couple years rounding out my skill set with data science and machine learning.   Here you can find some of my individual data projects, from linear regression to natural language processing to deep learning.  My personal favorite is [Hoops Hero](https://github.com/andreilevin/HoopsHero#hoops-hero), which also has an interactive web app you can play around with at [hoopshero.streamlit.app](https://hoopshero.streamlit.app) (recently selected as a featured app in the [Streamlit Gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery?category=sports-fun)).  You can watch a few of my brief project presentations in this YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0KPsix0c83NVM9DUZZZ6CvinG6qOK0M).

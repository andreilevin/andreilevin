### Hi, I'm Andrei — Welcome to my Github! 👋

I am a former quantum physicist (my PhD dissertation can be found [here](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/41121324)) who has spent the last couple of years learning data science and machine learning.   Here are a few of my individual data projects, from linear regression to natural language processing to deep learning.  My personal favorite is [Hoops Hero](https://github.com/andreilevin/HoopsHero), which also has an interactive web app you can play around with at [hoopshero.streamlitapp.com](https://hoopshero.streamlitapp.com).  You can watch some of my brief project presentations in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0KPsix0c83NVM9DUZZZ6CvinG6qOK0M).

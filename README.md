### Hi, I'm Andreiâ€” welcome to my Github! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recovering quantum physicist who has spent the last couple years learning all about data science and machine learning.   Here are some of my individual projects, from linear regression to natural language processing to deep learning.  My personal favorite is [Hoops Hero](https://github.com/andreilevin/HoopsHero), which also has an associated web app you can play around with at [hoopshero.streamlitapp.com](https://hoopshero.streamlitapp.com).
